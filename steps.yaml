Check if the browser supports geolocations.

Set options for high acurracy, a 5 second timeout, and no caching.

Use watch Position to track the users location continously.

Emit the latitude and longitude via a socket with "send-location". Log any errors to the console.

Initialize a map centered at cooridnates (0, 0) with a zoom level of 15 using Leaflet. Add Open street map tiles to the map.

Create an empty objects marker.s

When receiving location data via the socket, extract id, latitude and longitude, and center the map on the new coordinates.

If a marker for the id exists, update its position, otherwise create a new marker at the given coordinates and add it to the map.
When a user disconnects, remove their marker form the map and delete it from markers.
